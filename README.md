# Django Session based REST API(Custom Auth user Model)
This application has django REST API(Backend) and React(Frontend) applcation which uses session based user authentication schema. This application can be used as a get starter for a fullstack application.

## Backend
I strongly advice to make following changes at the very beginning of any django based project. Following these steps might reduce heavy code changes in Merge Requests(you can make small-sized MRs) which might 
save more time when merging/rebasing the pull requests. Further thelse steps might help to introduce good coding practices to your codebase at the very beginning of the project.

### 1. Custom Auth User
### 2. Linting
### 3. Add pyproject.toml file
### 4. Logger
### 5. Unit Testing

## Frontend
